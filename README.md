# Shmup-game

Source Code File: Shoot 'em up.py
This is a simple shooter game that I actually made for my AI class but it uses graphics in it.  It uses sprites that I drew myself and I utilized several PyGame functions to animate them by just moving them around.


Requires Python and Pygame to run.
Programmed using Python 2.7.3 32-bit and the corresponding version of Pygame.

There is no controller support but a program like JoyToKey or AniMicro can be used to map buttons to keyboard keys.

Keyboard controls are displayed on the title screen.
