# Shmup-game

Source Code File: Shoot 'em up.py
This is a simple shooter game that I actually made for my AI class but it uses graphics in it.  It uses sprites that I drew myself and I utilized several PyGame functions to animate them by just moving them around.



Requires Python and Pygame to run.
Programmed using Python 2.7.3 32-bit and the corresponding version of Pygame.

There is no controller support but a program like JoyToKey or AniMicro can be used to map buttons to keyboard keys.

Keyboard controls are displayed on the title screen.

Tested on:
-Windows Vista Service Pack 2 w/ AMD Phenom Processor Quad Core 2.4 Ghz and graphics card
-Windows XP Service Pack 2 w/ Intel Celeron M at ~1 Ghz and integreted graphics
