Source Code File: Shoot 'em up.py
This is a simple shooter game that I actually made for my AI class but it uses graphics in it.  It uses sprites that I drew myself and I utilized several PyGame functions to animate them by just moving them around.



Requires Python and Pygame to run.
Programmed using Python 2.7.3 32-bit and the corresponding version of Pygame.

Graphics files are to be placed in the same directory as the source code.

Xpadder was used for controller support with an Xbox 360 controller but neither are necessary.

Keyboard controls are displayed on the title screen.

Tested on:
-Windows Vista Service Pack 2 w/ AMD Phenom Processor Quad Core 2.4 Ghz and graphics card
-Windows XP Service Pack 2 w/ Intel Celeron M at ~1 Ghz and integreted graphics
